\section*{Introduction}

In this project we will introduce the \emph{Petersen graph} and highlight
some of its interesting properties, explain the construction of the
\emph{cross cap} and proceed to show how to embed the Petersen graph
onto the suface of the cross cap without any edge intersection --
an embedding that is not possible to achieve in the plane.

Using these results, we will subsequently create a video
using the software \emph{Maya} that visualizes the important aspects
of this construction. In particular, this visualizations can be
understood also by non-mathematicians.

\section{Theoretical Preliminaries}

We will first explore the construction of the Petersen graph and the
cross cap, highlighting interesting properties. We will then proceed
to motivate the embedding of the Petersen graph on the surface of the
cross cap.

\subsection{The Petersen Graph}

The Petersen graph is an important example from graph theory that has
proven to be useful in particular as a counterexample.

\begin{definition}[Kneser graph]
  The \emph{Kneser graph of n, k} (denoted $KG_{n,k}$) consists of
  the $k$-element subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ as vertices, where an
  edge connects two vertices if and only if the two sets corresponding
  to the vertices are disjoint.
\end{definition}

This graph is ${n-k}\choose k$-regular and has a chromatic number of
$n - 2k + 2$ \cite{kneser}. A special case is the Petersen graph $P =
KG_{5,2}$, called so after the Danish mathematician Julius Petersen
(1839--1910). See figures \ref{fig:petersen} and
\ref{fig:petersen-twointersect}.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=\textwidth]{../planar-graphs/petersen-grundlage.pdf}
    \caption{Traditional realization of the Petersen graph in the plane.
      The inner vertices and their edges form a pentagram; the outer
      vertices form a pentagon. This version exhibits five edge
      intersections.}
    \label{fig:petersen}
  \end{subfigure}\hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=\textwidth]{../planar-graphs/petersen-zweikreuzungen.pdf}
    \caption{The Petersen graph in the plane with just two edge
      intersections. It can be shown that this is the minimum number of
      intersections necessary when drawing the graph in the plane.}
    \label{fig:petersen-twointersect}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Two drawings of the Petersen graph in the plane}
\end{figure}

The Petersen graph has the following interesting properties \cite{petersen}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It has chromatic number $n - 2k + 2 = 3$, so an optimal vertex
    coloring needs at least three different colors (see figure
    \ref{fig:color-vertex})
  \item It has chromatic index 4, meaning a minimum edge coloring must
    use at least four different colors (see \ref{fig:color-edge})
  \item It is the smallest (and until 1946 the only known)
    \emph{snark} -- that is, a connected, bridgeless cubic graph with
    chromatic index 4
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=\textwidth]{../planar-graphs/petersen-vertex-threecoloring.pdf}

    \label{fig:color-edge}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{The Petersen graph has chromatic number 3 and chromatic index 4}
\end{figure}

The Petersen graph has crossing number $\operatorname{cr}(P) = 2$,
meaning it cannot be embedded into the plane with less than 2 edge
intersections \cite[p.~2]{crossingnr}. It can, however, be embedded
without any edge intersections on the surface of the cross cap.

\subsection{The Cross Cap}

\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
  The cross cap is a two-dimensional real manifold that is homeomorphic
  tho the real projective plane $\mathbb{R}P^2$.

  \begin{definition}[Real projective space]
    The \emph{real projective space} $\mathbb{R}P^n$ consists of the lines
    passing through the origin of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the case $n=1$,
    this is called the \emph{real projective line}; in the case $n=2$,
    \emph{real projective plane}.
  \end{definition}

  An equivalent (and more intuitive) construction for $\mathbb{R}P^n$
  can be given by identifying antipodal points of $S^n$. Hence, the real
  projective plane is topologically equivalent to $D^2$ with antipodal
  points at the border identified (see figure \ref{fig:rp2}).
\end{minipage}%
\hfill%
\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=\textwidth]{../planar-graphs/crosscap-construction.pdf}
    \caption{The topological view: How to glue $[0,1]\times[0,1]$
      together to construct the real projective plane.}
    \label{fig:rp2}
  \end{figure}
\end{minipage}%

\subsection{Embedding the Petersen graph on the cross cap}

Using this “planar model” of $\mathbb{R}P^2$, we can now easily see
that an embedding of the Petersen graph without edge intersection
onto the surface of the cross cap is in fact possible:

  \centering
  \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.7\textwidth]{../planar-graphs/crosscap-embedding-5.pdf}
  \caption{An embedding of the Petersen graph without edge
    intersection on the surface of the cross cap.}
  \label{fig:rp2-embedding}
\end{figure}

\section{The Animation}

In the last section we have seen how the Petersen graph can be embedded into the $\mathbb{R}P^2$ using a planar model. In our  animation we extended the visualization to a three dimensional level and taking advantage of being able to move around the object. Thus we created a vehicle to give a much more intuitive feeling of the crosscap(i.e. the $\mathbb{R}P^2$) itself and how the Peterson graph embedding does like.

In this section we will point out the aspects our animation is showing and also briefly explain the construction process.

\subsection{Highlights of the Animation}

The first part of our animation shows the cross cap being viewed by a camera going around the object. By seeing an object in (passive) motion the viewer is able to get an advanced picture of the focussed object. The route of the camera is chosen, such that the viewer will get a view from all important perspectives and be able to make a hole 3D picture on her own.

A special highlight is that we chose the texture to indicate the necessary selfintersection the object exhibits when displayed (and not embedded!) in three dimensional space. So the viewer sees the smooth structure of the object being violated at the selfintersection at a first glance. At the second glance he will see, how the smooth structure actually continues on the first occluded side of the object. \\

The second part of our animation shows how the Petersen graph is drawn on the surface of the cross cap. As motivation for the drawing order we used figure ...4... first drawing the lines in the middle that can be drawn without self intersection of edges even in the plane.
Then the camera makes a dramatic change focussing on how each particular of the remaining lines is drawn on the surface without producing any self intersection.

\subsection{Construction of the animation}

The object of most interest in our animation is the crosscap itself. First we started of using the constructionmethod being motivated in ...the article... . Right at the beginning by trying to understand the construction chosen in ...the article... we encountered the problem of having to spend a lot of imagination to get a grasp of the three dimensional model. On the other hand wikipedia provided pictures of the homeomorphic equivalent cross cap, that gave a better intuition.

Inspite the main advantage of the dodecahedron construction method -- subdividing the dodecahedron, cutting of its half and identifying the opposite (now "'open"') edges -- which is producing the Petersen graph "'for free"' as the original edges of the dodecahedron we chose the cross cap as depicted on wikipedia as this model was more symmetric giving a better idea of the object itself. \\

To model the crosscap instead of employing a parametrization, we used the modeling tools of maya that are quite intuitive to handle. So starting of with a highly subdivided grid we bent and flared it in the right directions getting an object very close to the parametrized cross cap version found in the internet.

To add the Petersengraph we projected suitable curves on the surface and thickend them in particular using sphere primitives to indicate the vertices of the graph. \\

A last detail being worth mentioned is the choice of the texture map. Using a practical construction that is different from the mathmatical one we were able to employ the texture map from figure using the indicated gluing pattern. In the 3D modell one can easily see how this texture map perfectly indicates the selfintersection without taking use of a parametrization imitating the true self intersection. \\

And now lean back and enjoy the animation! :)
