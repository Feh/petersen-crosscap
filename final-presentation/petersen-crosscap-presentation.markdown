The Kneser Graph
================

**Definition:**
The *Kneser graph of n, k* (denoted $KG_{n,k}$) consists of
the $k$-element subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ as vertices, where an
edge connects two vertices if and only if the two sets corresponding
to the vertices are disjoint.

* Regular with ${n-k}\choose k$ edges at each vertex
* Chromatic number $n - 2k + 2$

The Petersen Graph
==================

The *Petersen graph* realized as the Kneser graph $P = KG_{5,2}$

The Petersen Graph (III)
========================

**Definition:** A *Snark* is a connected, bridgeless cubic graph with chromatic
index 4 (i.e. it does not have an edge 3-coloring).

* Petersen graph is a snark
    * In fact the smallest possible snark (discovered 1898)
    * Tait 1880: Four Color Theorem equivalent to: No snark is planar
* Crossing number of Petersen graph is 2

=======================
